# Voice-Activated Timer

## Overview
A simple, voice-activated timer that you can use directly in your browser.
It is designed to help you easily set and manage rest periods while working out (or for any other activity where a countdown is needed).
An alert sound plays during the last 4 seconds of the countdown to ensure you are notified before time expires.


## Features

- **Voice Commands:** Control the timer using your voice. Just say commands like :
  - `30 seconds` to set a 30-second countdown.
  - `1 minute and 10 seconds` to set a 1 minute and 10 seconds countdown.

- **Automatic Listening:** The timer listens continuously for your commands, so you donâ€™t need to interact with the page manually.

- **Real-Time Display:** The remaining time is displayed in an easy-to-read format, even from a distance.

## How It Works

1. **Open the Timer:** Load the timer page in your browser.
2. **Speak Your Command:** Use voice commands to set the timer for your desired duration.
3. **Countdown Display:** The timer will start counting down and display the remaining time.
